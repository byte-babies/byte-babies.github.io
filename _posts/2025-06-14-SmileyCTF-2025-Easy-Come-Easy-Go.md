## Solution

<h2 id="easycomeeasygo">Easy Come Easy Go</h2>
The entry for go programs is `main.main`. In binary ninja, we get this for main:
![1](../assets/images/smileyctf2025easycomeeasygo/pic1.webp)
This first block, will check if there is enough RAM to load the program. If so, then we go to the right-block.
The right block will initialize [Go Channels](https://digitalyoshixi.github.io/zettelkasten/Programming/Go-Channels), five of them, aswell as print a `> ` and ask for user input with scanf.

![2](../assets/images/smileyctf2025easycomeeasygo/pic2.webp)

Then, a simple flag length check is done before progressing forwards

![3](../assets/images/smileyctf2025easycomeeasygo/pic3.webp)

Then, a series of [Goroutines](https://digitalyoshixi.github.io/zettelkasten/Programming/Goroutine) are called. A goroutine will have this structure of checking write barriers before every call.

![4](../assets/images/smileyctf2025easycomeeasygo/pic4.webp)

At the very end, rbx recieves data from a channel, which is then compared to be equal to 0. If they are equal, then we get the winner flag.

So, in essence, the very last goroutine we call which is `main.main.func3` will determine if we win or not. 

![5](../assets/images/smileyctf2025easycomeeasygo/pic5.webp)

Again, there is the check for sufficient RAM for the stack, we can just ignore that.

Notice that there is a series of assignments to the stack. 24 in fact, perfect with the length of our flag. Lets call this list `f3list`

![6](../assets/images/smileyctf2025easycomeeasygo/pic6.webp)

The following loop will check iterate through all characters from 1-24 and do the following:
1. Get the current number from `f3list[counter]`
2. Send this to a channel that func1 listens to, and recieve the output
3. XOR that output with `ourinput[counter]`, and send this to a channel that func2 listens to, and recieve that output
4. Check that output with a hardcoded output
If this loop passes 24 times, then we win.

I used [Delve](https://digitalyoshixi.github.io/zettelkasten/Programming/Delve) to actually see which function was listening to which channel, since GDB had issues with concurrency.

##### Final Script
```python
firstecx = [0xcc, 0x02, 0x84,0xf2,0x1a, 0x42, 0xb1, 0x3e, 0x82, 0x5d, 0x30, 0x44, 0x12, 0x51, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x2d, 0x4c, 0x51, 0xc1, 0x57, 0x47, 0xf,0xac]
lastecx = [0x5c, 0xef, 0x33, 0xd, 0x92, 0xd6, 0xc4, 0x58, 0xac, 0x23, 0x19, 0xf6, 0x76, 0x4, 0x25, 0x77, 0xd0, 0xdb, 0x1f, 0x90, 0x93, 0x3c, 0x90,0xf5]
func2 = [0xbe, 0xd6, 0x9b, 0xc4, 0xa6, 0xef, 0x12, 0x09, 0x46, 0x4d,0x44,0x83,0x05,0x3b,0x16,0x6a,0x95,0xa3,0x3e,0x64,0xf4,0x1f,0xe6,0x24]

listlen = len(firstecx)

for i in range(listlen):
    print(chr(firstecx[i] ^ func2[i] ^ lastecx[i]),end="")

for i in range(24-listlen):
    print("a",end="")
print("")
```

## Flag is: `.;,;.{goh3m1an_rh4p50dy}`
