## Solution

Opening up the site, we first see this:

![base site](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/normsite.png)

There's nothing obvious so we'll go ahead and look into the sources.

There an interesting comment here:
```html
<!-- incognitoctf is yummy -->
```

Let's see if it'll help us out in the future...

Alright, so looking at the network requests, we see something interesting in the headers.

![admin cookie 1](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/admincookie1.png)

```https
Cookie: admin=none
```

Well, it may be a reach but since incognitoctf is yummy -> cookie?

Let's try it out.

![incognitoctf cookie](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/meanmessage.png)

We get a really mean message which gives us a hint to use a ROT13 cipher for the cookie, let's try it.

Result:
![incognitoctf cookie 13](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/shifted13.png)

And here I gave up, but my teammate Yoshixi started checking every ROT of the cookie, i.e. ROT1, ROT2, ROT3, ROT4 ...

Apparently the other ROTs give you a bunch of different pages, but he gave me this:
`fkzldkfqlzqc` (ROT23)

And he found that this gave you this page:

![incognitoctf cookie 23](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/accessgranted.png)

Great! We get a link to a google drive with an audio file.

link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KBKmWwdTnro9WzNw-dm1mVIf14tI5QkD/view?usp=drive_link`

If you download it and listen to it, it sounds sped up. So I pop it into audacity and slow down the speed of it and listen closely. 

![audacity](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/audacity.png)

It is a guy saying letters with a very bad mic. It took a long time to actually figure out what he was saying but I ended up on: `nksqruxqeulq`

Throwing this into dCode, we get this:

![dcode result](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/dcode.png)

This obviously is suggesting that we use the byte file size as the flag and I totally didn't enter that as it.

So we can just run `ls -l' on the audio file and we get this:

![dcode result](../assets/images/incognito6brainr0t/size.png)

And we were able to get first blood on it.

## Flag is: `ictf{52712}`
